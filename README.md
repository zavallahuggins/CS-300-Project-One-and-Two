# CS-300-Project-One-and-Two

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The goal of this project was to print a list of courses, with the course numbers for the course, and prerequisites of each course, if they have it. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I used a binary search tree data structure to accomplish this goal. It is important to understand data structures so you know what would work best for this scenario along with the run time. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

If I faced any roadblocks, I would practice data structures on Codeacademy to solidify my knowledge of data structures. I also referenced the previous assignments since they provided some insight on how to manipulate each data structure. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

Working on this project has opened my eyes to a new level of program. Before this course, I was not considering run times or more efficient data structures to complete tasks. Now, when I develop code, I can consider multiple different options to tackle different problems.
